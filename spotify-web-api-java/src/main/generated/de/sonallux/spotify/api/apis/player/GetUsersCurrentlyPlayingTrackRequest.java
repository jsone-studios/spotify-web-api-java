 * <p>A successful request will return a <code>200 OK</code> response code with a json payload that contains information about the currently playing track or episode and its context (see below). The information returned is for the last known state, which means an inactive device could be returned if it was the last one to execute playback.</p>
 * <p>When no available devices are found, the request will return a <code>200 OK</code> response but with no data populated.</p>
 * <p>When no track is currently playing, the request will return a <code>204 NO CONTENT</code> response with no payload.</p>
 * <p>If private session is enabled the response will be a <code>204 NO CONTENT</code> with an empty payload.</p>
